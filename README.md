# ML-DataCleaning-EDA

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for preparing data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) prior to building machine learning models. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and feature preparation.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The notebook covers the following steps:

### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Handling missing values  
- Fixing inconsistent data  
- Removing duplicates  
- Dropping irrelevant columns  
- Converting data types  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Summary statistics  
- Distribution of features  
- Correlation analysis  
- Detecting outliers  
- Understanding patterns and relationships  

### **3. Preprocessing for Machine Learning**
- Encoding categorical features  
- Feature scaling  
- Train/Test split  
- Feature selection (if applied)

## 📁 Files Included
- **project.ipynb** — Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis steps.  
- **processed_data.csv** — The cleaned and preprocessed dataset.  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 🎯 Purpose
A complete, beginner-friendly ML pipeline demonstrating how to prepare a dataset for machine learning, explore its structure, and perform the necessary preprocessing steps.
